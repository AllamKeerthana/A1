# Parallel Image Filtering for Edge Detection

Image filtering and edge detection are fundamental techniques in image processing. However, when working with large images or applying complex filters, sequential execution can become slow and inefficient.
This project leverages OpenMPI to parallelize image filtering and edge detection, distributing the workload across multiple processors. The result is faster execution, better scalability, and efficient handling of large image datasets.

#Features
-Parallel image filtering using MPI for speed and efficiency.
-Implementation of common edge detection techniques (e.g., Sobel, Prewitt, or Canny).-Comparison of sequential vs. parallel execution performance.
-Supports varying numbers of processors for scalability.
-Modular code structure for easy extension with new filters.
